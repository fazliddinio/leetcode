==========================================
  Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days (LeetCode 1011)
==========================================

------------------------------------------
 Part 1: Official LeetCode Description
------------------------------------------

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another
within `days` days.

The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each
day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the given
order). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of
the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the
packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `days` days.

Example 1:
    Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
    Output: 15

Example 2:
    Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
    Output: 6

Constraints:
    - 1 <= days <= weights.length <= 5 * 10^4
    - 1 <= weights[i] <= 500


------------------------------------------
 Part 2: Simpler Explanation
------------------------------------------

Same as above — this is a duplicate folder for the same problem.
See capacity_to_ship_packages/problem.py for the full explanation.

Key idea: Binary search on the answer (ship capacity), and for each
candidate capacity, greedily simulate loading to count how many days
are needed.
