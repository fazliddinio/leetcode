# LeetCode Practice

My collection of LeetCode solutions. I'm using this repo to keep track of my progress and review common patterns.

Most solutions are in **Python**, focusing on clean code and optimal time complexity.

## Structure
I've organized problems by pattern rather than number:
- **Arrays & Hashing**
- **Two Pointers** & **Sliding Window**
- **Trees** & **Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**

Still working on improving some of the DP solutions!
